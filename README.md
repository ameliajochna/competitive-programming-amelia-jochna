# Competitive programming
These are some of the codes from competetive programming tasks I solved in years 2019-2023.

## Polish Olympiad in Informatics

I participated in the Olympiad 3 times throughout my high school years. Each time I got to the second stage of the competition which means I was among about 500 top polish high school students.

XVII OI in years 2020-2021 resulted in me taking 115th place during first stage and getting accepted to the second stage. I didn't get any further but it was a great achievement as it was only a year after a wrote the first line of code in my life.

XIX OI in years 2021-2022, I was 248th in the first stage and 112th in the second stage. Moreover, I participated in the Final of the Olympiad.

XXX OI in years 2022-2023, I took 21nd place in the first stage and participated in the second stage of the competition.

## Codeforces

I solved 344 problems on codeforces and participated in 74 contests, which resulted in rank Specialist with a contest rating of 1522. I also did virtual participation contests but it isn't included in the overall sum.

I was solving these problems in order to practice for the Olympiad and in some cases just for fun (especially in case of April Fools Day contest). Educational contests were especially helpful in training as they contain schemas which are often used in Olympiad's problems.

## Homework

Starting from 2019, I had coding classes at school which were supposed to prepare us for the Olympiad. I was also going to many coding camps where we were having contests and practices everyday.

In the 3rd grade I was having inividual coding lessons with a tutor who was experienced in International Olympiads in Informatics. He also set up contests just for me which I was having on every saturday for 5 hours.

As a training, I also participated in other contests organized mostly by University of Wroc≈Çaw such as Sparingi or Turnieje Programistyczne. Some of these competitions were part of the project MAP (Mistrzostwa w Algorytmice i Programowaniu).
